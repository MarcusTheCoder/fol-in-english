Diagram breakdown for sentances:
Legend:
    () = Keyword
    [x] = Variable
    [collection] = Collection variable

A sentance can be translated into a single line of FOL
    Sentance parts can be broken down into smaller pieces of FOL

    (For all) [x] and [y] in [collection],
    (For all) [x],[y], and [z] in [collection],
    (For all) = (For every)

    (There exists) a(n)[x] 
    (In) [collection], (There exists)
    -- the comma separates pieces of the FOL statement, initialized collections, and in general, provides pauses --

    (In) our [collection:universe], (there exists) (a) [tree].
    -- English Quantifiers
    -- a/an specifies one
    -- many specifies multiple objects
